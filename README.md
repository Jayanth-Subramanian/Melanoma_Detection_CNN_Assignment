# Melanoma_Detection_CNN_Assignment
>  Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

>  The Melanoma detection dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

> Problem Statement : To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- The Melanoma detection dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.
-  Problem statement is to create a CNN model that addresses class imbalance and/or any overfitting/underfitting issue in the data set and that can classify a given image into one of the nine categories()

## Conclusions
- Model 4 in the notebook is the finalized model that has addressed the class imbalance issue and overfitting and also have a decent accuracy metrics

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Tensorflow
- Keras
